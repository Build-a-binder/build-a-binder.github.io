Serafin is a journalist at a newspaper who has written a few article where a large part of the research involved digging into datasets and working with designers to get nice figures for the article. For this they needed to scrape websites and do a lot of data cleaning, they used R (or Jupyter) notebooks for this. News is a fast paced business and there were many iterations of the same article. They used git to keep track of the code and notebooks but datasets and final visuals were still shared by email. Serafin is a self taught programmer, learning by doing. Having a simple tool that could help with sharing work internally and making sure that results can be reproduced by others would be very useful to avoid misunderstandings. After the story breaks they might even publish their notebooks so others can check for themselves that the facts hold up.
